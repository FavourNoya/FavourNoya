# Data Cleaning

```{r}
# Assign -1 to any missing shipment ID
data$number[is.na(data$number)] <- -1 

# Filter out invalid shipments (where cost = 0)
data <- filter(data, `($)` > 0)

# Remove duplicate rows
data <- distinct(data)
```

# Data Transformation

```{r}
# Add cost per KG-KM column
data <- mutate(data, cost_per_kgkm = `($)` / `KG-KM`)

# Select and rename relevant columns
data <- data %>%
  select(carier, `($)`, days, `longest diagonal`, cost_per_kgkm) %>%

    Carrier_Name = carier,
    Delivery_Cost = `($)`,
    Delivery_Time = days
  ) %>%

  relocate(Delivery_Time, .before = `longest diagonal`) %>%
  arrange(Delivery_Time) %>%
  distinct()  # double-check duplicates removed
```

# Visual Insights

## Are Shorter Delivery Times More Expensive?

```{r}
#| label: plot-cost-vs-time
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between Delivery Time and Cost"
ggplot(data, aes(x = Delivery_Time, y = Delivery_Cost)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Delivery Time vs Shipment Cost")
```

## Shipments by Carrier

```{r}
#| label: shipments-by-carrier
#| fig-cap: "Total Shipments Completed by Each Carrier"
data %>%
  count(Carrier_Name) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Carrier_Name, y = n, fill = Carrier_Name)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Number of Shipments by Carrier")
```

## Average Cost per Shipment by Carrier

```{r}
#| label: avg-cost-carrier
#| fig-cap: "Average Cost Per Shipment by Carrier"
data %>%
  group_by(Carrier_Name) %>%
  summarize(Average_Cost = mean(Delivery_Cost, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Carrier_Name, y = Average_Cost, fill = Carrier_Name)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Cost per Shipment by Carrier")
```

## Cost per KG-KM by Carrier

```{r}
#| label: cost-kgkm-carrier
#| fig-cap: "Total Cost Per KG-KM by Carrier"
data %>%
  group_by(Carrier_Name) %>%
  summarize(Total_Cost_per_KGKM = sum(cost_per_kgkm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Carrier_Name, y = Total_Cost_per_KGKM, fill = Carrier_Name)) +

```

## How Does Longest Diagonal Impact Cost?

```{r}
#| label: diag-vs-cost
#| fig-cap: "Longest Diagonal vs Cost"
ggplot(data, aes(x = `longest diagonal`, y = Delivery_Cost)) +
  geom_point() +

## NOTES 2 SELF:

-   Quarto really helps keep my code and explanation organized in one place, so basically no more flipping between script and doc.

-   Inline chunk labels, fig captions, and YAML options legit make everything more readable...future me will thank me.

-   If I ever need to export this to Word or PDF, it's already set up for that (God bless the YAML section).

-   Overall, in comparison to the previous Whole Game Project, we got a much cleaner doc, clearer thoughts, & less chaos. 10/10 would do again.
